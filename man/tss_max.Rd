\usage{
tss_max(data, ...)

\method{tss_max}{data.frame}(
  data,
  truth,
  ...,
  estimator = NULL,
  na_rm = TRUE,
  event_level = "first",
  case_weights = NULL
)

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Either a data.frame containing the columns specified by the truth
and estimate arguments, or a table/matrix where the true class results
should be in the columns of the table.}

\item{...}{A set of unquoted column names or one or more dplyr selector
functions to choose which variables contain the class probabilities. If
truth is binary, only 1 column should be selected, and it should correspond
to the value of event_level. Otherwise, there should be as many columns as
factor levels of truth and the ordering of the columns should be the same
as the factor levels of truth.}

\item{truth}{The column identifier for the true class results (that is a
factor). This should be an unquoted column name although this argument is
passed by expression and supports quasiquotation (you can unquote column
names). For _vec() functions, a factor vector.}

\item{estimator}{One of "binary", "hand_till", "macro", or "macro_weighted"
to specify the type of averaging to be done. "binary" is only relevant for
the two class case. The others are general methods for calculating
multiclass metrics. The default will automatically choose "binary" if truth
is binary, "hand_till" if truth has >2 levels and case_weights isn't
specified, or "macro" if truth has >2 levels and case_weights is specified
(in which case "hand_till" isn't well-defined).}

\item{na_rm}{A logical value indicating whether NA values should be stripped
before the computation proceeds.}

\item{event_level}{A single string. Either "first" or "second" to specify
which level of truth to consider as the "event". This argument is only
applicable when estimator = "binary". The default uses an internal helper
that generally defaults to "first"}

\item{case_weights}{The optional column identifier for case weights. This
should be an unquoted column name that evaluates to a numeric column in
data. For _vec() functions, a numeric vector.}

\item{estimate}{If truth is binary, a numeric vector of class probabilities
corresponding to the "relevant" class. Otherwise, a matrix with as many
columns as factor levels of truth. It is assumed that these are in the same
order as the levels of truth.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns .metric, .estimator, and .estimate and 1 row
of values. For grouped data frames, the number of rows returned will be the
same as the number of groups.

\description{
The True Skills Statistic, which is defined as
}
\details{
\emph{sensitivity}+\emph{specificity} +1

This function calibrates the probability threshold to classify presences to
maximise the TSS.

There is no multiclass version of this function, it only operates on binary
predictions (e.g. presences and absences in SDMs).
