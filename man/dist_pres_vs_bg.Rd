\title{Distance between the distribution of climate values for presences vs
background}
\usage{
dist_pres_vs_bg(.data, .col)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{a \code{data.frame} (or derived object, such as \code{tibble}, or \code{sf})
with values for the bioclimate variables for presences and background}

\item{.col}{the column containing the presences; it assumes presences to be
the first level of this factor}
}
\value{
a name vector of distances
}
\description{
For each environmental variable, this function computes the density functions
of presences and absences and returns (1-overlap), which is a measure of the
distance between the two distributions. Variables with a high distance are
good candidates for SDMs, as species occurrences are confined to a subset of
the available background.
