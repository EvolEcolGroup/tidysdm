\description{
This function facilitates using \link[spatialsample:spatial_block_cv]{spatialsample::spatial_block_cv} multiple
times in an analysis. \link[spatialsample:spatial_block_cv]{spatialsample::spatial_block_cv} creates a grid based
on the object in \code{data}. However, if spatial blocks are generated multiple
times in an analysis (e.g. for a \code{\link[=spatial_initial_split]{spatial_initial_split()}}, and then
subsequently for cross-validation on the training dataset), it might be
desirable to keep the same grid). By applying this function to the largest
dataset, usually the full dataset before \code{\link[=spatial_initial_split]{spatial_initial_split()}}. The
resulting cellsize can be used as an option in
\link[spatialsample:spatial_block_cv]{spatialsample::spatial_block_cv}.
