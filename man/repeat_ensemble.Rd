\description{
An ensemble based multiple sets of pseudoabsences/background. This object is
a collection (list) of \code{\link{simple_ensemble}} objects for which predictions will
be combined in a simple way (e.g. by taking either the mean or median). Each
\code{\link{simple_ensemble}} contains the best version of a each given model type
following turning; all simple ensembles will need to have the same metric
estimated during the cv process.
