\title{Find threshold that optimises a given metric}
\usage{
optim_thresh(truth, estimate, metric, event_level = "first")
}
\arguments{
\item{truth}{The column identifier for the true class results (that is a
factor). This should be an unquoted column name although this argument is
passed by expression and supports quasiquotation (you can unquote column
names). For _vec() functions, a factor vector.}

\item{estimate}{the predicted probability for the event}

\item{metric}{character of metric to be optimised. Currently only "tss_max",
"kap_max", and "sensitivity" with a given target (e.g.
c("sensitivity",0.8))}

\item{event_level}{A single string. Either "first" or "second" to specify
which level of truth to consider as the "event". This argument is only
applicable when estimator = "binary". The default uses an internal helper
that generally defaults to "first"}
}
\value{
the probability threshold for the event
}
\description{
This function returns the threshold to turn probabilities into binary classes
whilst optimising a given metric. Currently available for \code{\link{tss_max}},
\code{\link{kap_max}} and \code{sensitivity} (for which a target sensitivity is required).
}
\examples{
optim_thresh(two_class_example$truth, two_class_example$Class1,
             metric = c("tss_max"))
optim_thresh(two_class_example$truth, two_class_example$Class1,
             metric = c("sens", 0.9))
