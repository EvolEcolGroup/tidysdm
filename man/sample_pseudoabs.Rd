\usage{
sample_pseudoabs(
  data,
  raster,
  n,
  coords = NULL,
  method = "random",
  class_label = "pseudoabs",
  return_pres = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::sf}} data frame, or a data frame with coordinate
variables. These can be defined in \code{coords}, unless they have standard
names (see details below).}

\item{raster}{the \link[terra:SpatRaster-class]{terra::SpatRaster} or \code{stars} from which cells will be
sampled}

\item{n}{number of pseudoabsence points to sample}

\item{coords}{a vector of length two giving the names of the "x" and "y"
coordinates, as found in \code{data}. If left to NULL, the function will try to
guess the columns based on standard names \code{c("x", "y")}, \code{c("X","Y")},
\code{c("longitude", "latitude")}, or \code{c("lon", "lat")}}

\item{method}{sampling method. One of 'random', 'dist_min', 'dist_max', or
'dist_disc'. Threshold distances are set as additional elements of a
vector, e.g c('dist_min',70000) or c('dist_disc',50000,200000).}

\item{class_label}{the label given to the sampled points. Defaults to
\code{pseudoabs}}

\item{return_pres}{return presences together with pseudoabsences in a single
tibble}
}
\value{
An object of class \link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble}. If presences are returned, the
presence level is set as the reference (to match the expectations in the
\code{yardstick} package that considers the first level to be the event)
}
\description{
This function samples pseudo-absence points from a raster given a set of
presences. The locations returned as the center points of the sampled cells,
which can not overlap with the presences (in contrast to background points,
see \link{sample_background}). The following methods are implemented:
\itemize{
\item 'random': pseudo-absences randomly sampled from the region covered by the
raster (i.e. not NAs).
\item 'dist_min': pseudo-absences randomly sampled from the region excluding
a buffer
of 'dist_min' from presences (distances in 'm' for lonlat rasters, and in map
units for projected rasters).
\item 'dist_max': pseudo-absences randomly sampled from the unioned buffers
of 'dist_max' from presences (distances in 'm' for lonlat rasters, and in map
units for projected rasters). Using the union of buffers means that areas
that are in multiple buffers are not oversampled. This is also referred to as
"thickening".
\item 'dist_disc': pseudo-absences randomly sampled from the unioned discs
around presences
with the two values of 'dist_disc' defining the minimum and maximum distance
from presences.
