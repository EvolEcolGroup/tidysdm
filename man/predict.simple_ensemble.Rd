\usage{
\method{predict}{simple_ensemble}(
  object,
  new_data = NULL,
  type = "prob",
  fun = "mean",
  metric_thresh = NULL,
  class_thresh = NULL,
  members = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an simple_ensemble object}

\item{new_data}{a data frame in which to look for variables with which to predict.
If \code{NULL}, the predictors from the first workflow in the ensemble are used;
note that this only makes sense if all workflows have the same predictors.}

\item{type}{the type of prediction, "prob" or "class".}

\item{fun}{string defining the aggregating function. It can take values
\code{mean}, \code{median}, \code{weighted_mean}, \code{weighted_median} and \code{none}. It is possible
to combine multiple functions, except for "none". If it
is set to "none", only the individual member predictions are returned (this
automatically sets \code{member} to TRUE)}

\item{metric_thresh}{a vector of length 2 giving a metric and its threshold,
which will be used to prune
which models in the ensemble will be used for the prediction. The 'metrics'
need to have been computed when the workflow was tuned. Examples are
c("accuracy",0.8) or c("boyce_cont",0.7)}

\item{class_thresh}{probability threshold used to convert probabilities into
classes. It can be a number (between 0 and 1), or a character metric (currently
"tss_max" or "sensitivity"). For sensitivity, an additional target value is passed
along as a second element of a vector, e.g. c("sensitivity",0.8).}

\item{members}{boolean defining whether individual predictions for each member
should be added to the ensemble prediction. The columns for individual members
have the name of the workflow a a prefix, separated by "." from the usual
column names of the predictions.}

\item{...}{not used in this method.}
}
\value{
a tibble of predictions
}
\description{
Predict for a new dataset by using a simple ensemble. Predictions from individual
models (i.e. workflows) are combined according to \code{fun}
