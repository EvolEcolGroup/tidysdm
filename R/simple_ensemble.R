#' Simple ensemble
#'
#' A simple ensemble is a collection of workflows for which predictions will be
#' combined in a simple way (e.g. by taking either the mean or median). Usually
#' these workflows will consists each of the best version of a given model
#' algorithm following tuning. The workflows are fitted to the full training
#' dataset before making predictions.
#'
#' @param ... not used, this function just creates an empty `simple_ensemble`
#'   object. Members are added with `add_best_candidates()`
#' @returns an empty `simple_ensemble`. This is a tibble with columns:
#' * `wflow_id`: the name of the workflows for which the best model was
#'   chosen
#' * `workflow`: the trained workflow objects
#' * `metrics`: metrics based on the crossvalidation resampling used
#'   to tune the models
