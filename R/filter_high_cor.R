#' Deprecated: Filter to retain only variables below a given correlation threshold
#'
#' THIS FUNCTION IS DEPRECATED. USE `filter_collinear` with `method=cor_caret` instead
#'
#' This method finds a subset of variable such that all have a correlation
#' below a certain cutoff. There are methods for [`terra::SpatRaster`],
#' [`data.frame`], and to work directly on a correlation matrix that was
#' previously estimated. For `data.frame`, only numeric variables will be
#' considered.
#' The algorithm is based on `caret::findCorrelation`, using the `exact` option.
#' The absolute values of pair-wise correlations are considered. If two
#' variables have a high correlation, the function looks at the mean absolute
#' correlation of each variable and removes the variable with the largest mean
#' absolute correlation.
#'
#' There are several function in the package `subselect`
#' that can also be used to accomplish
#' the same goal but tend to retain more predictors.
#'
#' @param x A [`terra::SpatRaster`] object, a data.frame (with only numeric
#' variables), or a correlation matrix
#' @param cutoff A numeric value for the pair-wise absolute correlation cutoff
#' @param verbose A boolean for printing the details
#' @param names a logical; should the column names be returned `TRUE` or
#' the column index `FALSE`)?
#' @param to_keep A vector of variable names that we want to force in the set
#' (note that the function will return an error if the correlation among any of
#' those variables is higher than the cutoff).
#' @returns A vector of names of columns that are below the correlation threshold
#' (when \code{names = TRUE}), otherwise a vector of indices. Note that the indices
#' are only for numeric variables (i.e. if factors are present, the indices do
#' not take them into account).
