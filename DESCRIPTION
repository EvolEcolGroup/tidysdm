Description: Fit species distribution models (SDMs) using the 'tidymodels' framework, 
  which provides a standardised interface to define models and process their 
  outputs. 'tidysdm' expands 'tidymodels' by providing methods for spatial objects,
  models and metrics specific to SDMs,
  as well as a number of specialised functions to process occurrences
  for contemporary and palaeo datasets. The full 
  functionalities of the package are described
  in Leonardi et al. (2023) <doi:10.1101/2023.07.24.550358>.
