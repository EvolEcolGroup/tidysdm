Description: Fit species distribution models (SDMs) using the `tidymodels` framework, 
  which provides a standardised interface to define models and process their 
  outputs. `tidysdm` expands `tidymodels` by providing methods for spatial objects,
  as well a number of specialised functions to process presences and pseudoabsences
  for present-day datasets and palaeo datasets. Its full 
  functionalities are described
  in Leonardi et al. (2023) <doi:10.1101/2023.07.24.550358>.
