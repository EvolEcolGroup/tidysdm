# tidysdm: Species Distribution Models with Tidymodels

Fit species distribution models (SDMs) using the 'tidymodels' framework,
which provides a standardised interface to define models and process
their outputs. 'tidysdm' expands 'tidymodels' by providing methods for
spatial objects, models and metrics specific to SDMs, as well as a
number of specialised functions to process occurrences for contemporary
and palaeo datasets. The full functionalities of the package are
described in Leonardi et al. (2024) \< doi:10.1111/2041-210X.14406\>.
